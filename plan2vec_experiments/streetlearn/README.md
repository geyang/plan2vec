# Plan2Vec on DeepMind Streetlearn

## How to debug?

Getting supervised learning to work is a lot faster. We need to make sure that the network can actually over-fit.

1. 2D visualization: show color array for the map
2. how about supervised coordinates?
1. coordinate supervision 
2. value function supervision + different set of parameters
3. value iteration w/ ground-truth neighbors
4. value iteration w/ local function
1. review models, see which ones are needed for streetlearn

Might want to compare embedding learned via local metric function vs those of global.

## Done

- [x] oracle planner baseline: [73Â±5% on small and medium]
- [x] choose a different model / add a collection of models
